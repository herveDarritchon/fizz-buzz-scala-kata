## Synopsis

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

## Motivation

Doing kata is a good way to either enhance its skills in programming and to learn a language.
It's why I have decided to do some kata to learn functional programming and Scala.

## Installation

If you want to do the kata, you can clone the master branch to start the kata.
    git clone -b master https://github.com/herveDarritchon/fizz-buzz-scala-kata.git

## Tests

I have done a branch for unitary test if you want.
It's a good way to start, I have provided a branch with only the tests and you have to code the app.
    git clone -b tdd https://github.com/herveDarritchon/fizz-buzz-scala-kata.git
